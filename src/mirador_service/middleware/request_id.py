"""Request-ID middleware — extracts ``X-Request-ID`` or generates a UUID.

Mirrors the Java side's ``RequestIdFilter``. Every request gets a unique
ID that :
- propagates back in the response as ``X-Request-ID`` header,
- binds into the structlog context so every log line within the request
  carries ``request_id=<uuid>``,
- propagates into the OpenTelemetry span as a ``http.request.id`` attribute.

Lets you grep Loki for ``{service="mirador-service-python"} |= "request_id=abc-123"``
to see EVERY log line for a single request — across handler + DB + Kafka
producer / consumer paths.
