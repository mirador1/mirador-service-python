"""Audit trail for MCP tool calls.

The Java sibling persists every MCP tool call as a row in the
``audit_event`` table (single trail with login audits, see ADR-0062
§"Audit"). The Python service does NOT yet have an audit_event DB
table — adding one would be a schema migration outside this MR's
scope. Until that lands, we emit a structured log entry per call :

- INFO log line with action=MCP_TOOL_CALL + tool name + args hash + user
- routed through the ring buffer + structlog pipeline
- ends up in Loki via the existing OTel exporter when the deploy
  has Loki ; stays local in the ring buffer otherwise

This is the same audit-payload SHAPE the Java sibling ships : when the
Python schema gains the ``audit_event`` table (tracked in TASKS.md),
:func:`record_tool_call` will additionally write the row ; downstream
consumers don't care which path produced the event.

NEVER log the raw args (could leak PII like customer emails, idempotency
keys, JWT subs). Args are hashed to an 8-char SHA-256 prefix — enough
to dedupe identical retries while stripping sensitive content.
