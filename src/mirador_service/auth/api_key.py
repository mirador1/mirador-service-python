"""Static API-key authentication — machine-to-machine fallback to JWT.

Mirrors the Java sibling's
:java:`com.mirador.auth.ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter`. Reads an
``X-API-Key`` request header, compares against the configured secret
(``MIRADOR_API_KEY`` env, default ``demo-api-key-2026``), and on match :

- For REST routes : populates ``request.state.api_key_user`` so
  :func:`mirador_service.auth.deps.current_user` can short-circuit JWT
  decoding and return an admin-scoped :class:`AuthenticatedUser`.
- For the MCP sub-app at ``/mcp/`` : injects a synthetic
  ``Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`` header into the ASGI scope so the
  MCP SDK's :class:`mcp.server.auth.middleware.bearer_auth.BearerAuthBackend`
  picks the API key up. :class:`mirador_service.mcp.auth.McpTokenVerifier`
  recognises the API-key token (path 2 in its ``verify_token``) and
  returns an admin-scoped :class:`AccessToken`.

Header miss / mismatch : pure pass-through. JWT chain handles auth as
usual. No 401 is emitted from this middleware — the API key is purely
additive to JWT, never restrictive.

The synthetic principal is ``api-key-user`` with role ``ROLE_ADMIN`` —
identical to the Java filter so admin-only MCP tools (e.g.
``trigger_chaos_experiment``, ``get_health_detail``) work without a
JWT login flow. Production deployments must inject the key from a
secrets manager (Vault, AWS SSM) — never hardcode in env files
checked into the repo.

#: Role granted on API-key match. The Java filter grants BOTH
#: ``ROLE_USER`` and ``ROLE_ADMIN`` ; the Python side encodes this as
#: a single ``ROLE_ADMIN`` because the MCP layer treats admin as a
#: superset of user (see :mod:`mirador_service.mcp.auth` ``scopes``
#: assembly logic — ``ROLE_ADMIN`` → ``[ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN]``). REST
#: side uses :func:`require_role` which checks one role at a time, so
#: the admin grant covers both ``require_role("ROLE_ADMIN")`` and
#: ``require_role("ROLE_USER")``-equivalent paths via explicit checks.

class ApiKeyMiddleware:
    """ASGI middleware — translates ``X-API-Key`` into auth context.

    Registered as the OUTERMOST middleware (runs FIRST on inbound
    requests) so it can rewrite the scope's headers BEFORE the MCP
    sub-app's bearer-auth backend runs. Order matches Spring's
    ``ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter`` running before
    ``JwtAuthenticationFilter`` in the filter chain.

    Behaviour :

    1. No ``X-API-Key`` header → pure pass-through. JWT path runs as
       usual.
    2. ``X-API-Key`` present but doesn't match configured key → pure
       pass-through (still no 401 emitted ; the JWT path will reject
       if it can't authenticate either). The Java filter behaves
       identically — silent drop, fall through to next filter.
    3. ``X-API-Key`` matches → marks the scope so REST handlers see
       the API-key principal, AND injects a synthetic
       ``Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`` header so the MCP SDK's
       bearer-auth backend picks it up downstream.

    The "set state ON SCOPE not ON request" detail matters : Starlette's
    ``request.state`` is a per-request namespace stored ON THE SCOPE,
    so writing ``scope['state']['api_key_user']`` here is observable
    via ``request.state.api_key_user`` in the FastAPI dependency layer.
    Sub-apps mounted at ``/mcp`` see the same scope (Starlette propagates
    it through ``app.mount``), so the synthetic Bearer header is
    visible to the MCP SDK without any extra wiring.
