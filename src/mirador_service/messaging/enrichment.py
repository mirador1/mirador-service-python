"""Kafka request-reply broker for customer enrichment.

Mirrors Java's `ReplyingKafkaTemplate` + `@KafkaListener` round-trip
(`Pattern 2 — synchronous request-reply over a broker`) :

1. HTTP handler builds a ``CustomerEnrichRequest`` and calls
   ``EnrichmentService.request_reply``.
2. Service generates a fresh ``correlation-id`` (UUID) header, registers
   an awaitable future, sends the request to ``customer.enrich.request``,
   then ``await asyncio.wait_for(future, timeout)``.
3. A background consumer task on ``customer.enrich.request`` calls
   ``EnrichmentService.handle_request`` which computes the enrichment
   (``displayName = "Name <email>"``) and produces the reply on
   ``customer.enrich.reply`` with the same correlation-id.
4. A second background consumer task on ``customer.enrich.reply`` parses
   the message and calls ``EnrichmentService.deliver_reply``, completing
   the future.
5. The HTTP handler unblocks and returns the enriched payload.

Self-loop demo : same service is both client AND server. In a real
deployment the request and reply consumers would live in different
microservices.

Testability : the broker owns NO IO of its own — producer/consumer
lifecycles are managed by ``messaging.kafka_client`` and injected here.
Unit tests use ``unittest.mock.AsyncMock`` instead of a real Kafka.
