"""Unit tests for :mod:`mirador_service.mcp.mount`.

Verifies the wiring contract :
- the mount path is /mcp (matches Java sibling + ADR-0062)
- exactly 15 tools are registered (14 baseline + predict_customer_churn
  shipped in Phase C of shared ADR-0061)
- tool names match the canonical TOOL_NAMES tuple
- mounting is idempotent (re-call is a no-op)
